The React Form Project demonstrates the development of a simple, interactive landing page with a functional modal form. The landing page features a button labeled "Enter the Data," which, when clicked, opens a modal containing a form. This form allows users to input their name, email, and select a color from a dropdown menu. Upon submission, the entered data is stored locally in the React Virtual DOM, and the modal closes. The submitted data is then dynamically displayed on the page, showcasing React's ability to handle state updates and re-renders seamlessly.

This project serves as a hands-on example of how to build reusable and interactive components using React, emphasizing key concepts like component-based architecture, state management, and event handling. Additionally, it integrates basic HTML and CSS for layout and styling, making the project visually appealing and functional.
